# shiny-dash1
My first shiny dashboard project, a variety of analysis using a useful group of libraries. In the final section of this dashboard you can predict the price using the parameters used in the RL model I created!. It contains information about House Rent Prediction Dataset dataset from Kaggle, you can check it here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset.
This repository also contains the analysis and linear regression model in the "analysis_and_lr.R" script.
